# page-generator


## installation

### 1. create a virtual environment for python 3.8.

`virtualenv venv`

### 2. Install flask.

`pip install flask`

### 3. Note that the images are generated from images in static/images. So *Background Image* currently has to match a filename already in that directory.



## running the app

### 1. To run the application, make sure you're in the root directory *page-generator*.



## Improvements

### 1. A more user friendly GUI for uploading images, and selecting colours, etc.
### 2. Resolve localization handling.
