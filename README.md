# page-generator


## Installation

#### 1. create a virtual environment for python 3.8.

`virtualenv venv`

#### 2. Install flask.

`pip install flask`

#### 3. Notes.
##### The images are generated from images already in static/images. So *Background Image* currently has to match a filename already in that directory.



## Running the app

#### 1. To run the application, make sure you're in the root directory *page-generator*.



## Improvements

#### 1. A more user friendly GUI for uploading images, and selecting colours, etc.
#### 2. Resolve localization handling.
